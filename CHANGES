CHANGES

20130104 -  Fix test errors caused by Perl::Tidy::perltidy v20121207

            requires Perl::Tidy::perltidy >= v20121207.

20120621 -  Fix errors caused by Perl::Tidy::perltidy now disallowing
            a scalar reference as the "stderr" option.

20120621 -  Some cleanup:

 1) MANIFEST was missing t/_perltidyrc.txt

 2) Updated build instructions in README

 3) Updated .gitignore

20110323 -  Add dependency on "parent" for CPANTESTERS

20110320 -  Resolve several open bugs and feature requests:

 1) Allow specifying top-level path to start search for files to test
    (instead of always using ".").

 2) Allow specifying a perltidyrc file to test against.

 3) Allow specifying files or directories to exclude from testing.

 4) Fix so distribution passes its own tidyness tests.

20080429 -  A file is tidy wrt a version of Perl::Tidy
            (even Test::PerlTidy fell prey to this subtle issue)

            Changed the META.yml file to be valid YAML
