Test::PerlTidy

To install please follow the following steps:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

During the tests the code checks that all the perl files included with
the distribution are tidy. If you make any changes please remember to
tidy them.

Any problems let me know: evdb@ecclestoad.co.uk
