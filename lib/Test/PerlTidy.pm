=head1 NAME
 
Test::PerlTidy - check that all your files are tidy.
 
=head1 SYNOPSIS
 
    # In a file like 't/perltidy.t'
    use Test::PerlTidy;
    run_tests();

=head1 DESCRIPTION
 
This rather unflattering comment was made in a piece by Ken Arnold:

    "Perl is a vast swamp of lexical and syntactic swill and nobody
    knows how to format even their own code well, but it's the only
    major language I can think of (with the possible exception of the
    recent, yet very Java-like C#) that doesn't have at least one
    style that's good enough."
              http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=74230

Hmmm... He is sort of right in a way. Then again the piece he wrote
was related to Python which is somewhat strict about formatting
itself.

Fear not though - now you too can have your very own formatting
gestapo in the form of Test::PerlTidy! Simply add a test file as
suggested above and any file ending in .pl, .pm, .t or .PL will cause
a test fail unless it is exactly as perltidy would like it to be.

=head1 REASONS TO DO THIS

If the style is mandated in tests then it will be adhered to.

If perltidy decides what is a good style then there should be no
quibbling.

If the style never changes then cvs diffs stop catching changes that
are not really there.

Readability might even improve.

=head1 HINTS

If you want to change the default style then muck around with
'.perltidyrc';

To quickly make a file work then try 'perltidy -b the_messy_file.pl'.
